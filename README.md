Pimage standalone from SGAT. 

This aims to be
 - Pimage sample and time spent binning for SGAT
 - Pimage time-series grid samples from external DB

TODO

 - build Pimage with two parts, main list of pimg and subsequent metadata

 - current pimg holds grid extent and grain, strictly it only needs
  its offset, its time and (possibly) duration
